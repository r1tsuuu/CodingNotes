# ðŸ“˜ CodingNotes

Welcome to **CodingNotes** â€” my personal digital notebook for all things programming.

This repo contains my daily learning logs, technical notes, and project insights as I build my skills as a developer. It's an evolving space where I track progress, reflect on concepts, and break down what Iâ€™ve learned in simple, structured markdown files.

The original idea and format of this digital notebook is credited to Miraya Tech: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirayatech/
