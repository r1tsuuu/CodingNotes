## ðŸ§  What did I work on today?

- Worked on day 17-18 of 100 days of code

## ðŸ“˜ What did I learn?

- [concept summaries, explanations, or example code]
- Learned more on OOP and its benefits, then tackled the turtle module and its GUI. Also, delved a bit on what is a tuple and the different ways we can import modules.
- This day was pretty straightforward and I had no major blockers.

## ðŸš§ Any blockers?

- No major blockers, but I need to work on my drive to solve the problems by myself and resist the urge to AI them as it will hinder my learning. I'll get there eventually.
